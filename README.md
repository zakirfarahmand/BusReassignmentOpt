# Bus Reassignment Optimization 
This repository contains code and resources for optimizing bus reassignment in urban transit systems, focusing on mitigating in-vehicle overcrowding during weather-related disruptions. The approach reassign buses dynamically from low-demand trips to lines where the demand is exceeding capacity, minimizing the need for additional buses or drivers.

## Data Input
Occupancy Data: Contains boarding and alighting counts for each trip.
Network Graph: Represents the transit network as a directed graph.
Timetable: Includes line details, stop times, and vehicle assignments.
Deadhead Time: Precomputed travel time for buses operating without passengers.
